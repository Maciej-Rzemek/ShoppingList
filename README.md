# ShoppingList
Recruitment Task

Generally I am quite happy that I was able to deliver an application of this quality having only last 3 days. I have tried my best to keep my code clean with clear architecture. There are few things which I would correct if I had more time.
First is sorting Shopping Lists by date. Right now I keep dates in a normal String instead of LocalDate or other date format
Second is lack of tests. I started learning them not so long ago, and I still donâ€™t feel confident enough to use it.
I guess that next time I would implement baseFragment and baseViewModel and try to implement generic View Binding. That would take away some boilerplate code such as bindings init or allow to handle showEmptyListLabel() just in BaseFragment.
Overall app development process was quite demanding, but I am glad of what I have accomplished. That was good and valuable experience :)
